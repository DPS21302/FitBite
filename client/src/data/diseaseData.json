    "description": "Osteoporosis is a bone disease that occurs when the body loses too much bone, makes too little bone, or both. As a result, bones become weak and may break from a fall or, in serious cases, from sneezing or minor bumps. Osteoporosis means 'porous bone' and is often called a silent disease because bone loss occurs without symptoms.",
